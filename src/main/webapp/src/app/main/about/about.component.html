      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>The creators of this website have implemented a working JWT-authentication to ensure maximum safety to all
        users. It has a role-based authorisation implemented so that only admins are allowed to edit users in the
        user-management section.</p>

      <h3>Rich Client</h3>
      <p>The website ChatterChatter consists of two separate applications which are running simultaneously. The angular
        app
        provides the HTML, CSS and JavaScript while the backend, a spring boot application, takes care of the user
        management and persistence.</p>
